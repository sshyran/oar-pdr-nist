        "This database was distributed for use in development and testing of automated mugshot identification systems. The database consists of one zipped file, containing a total of 3,248 images of variable size using PNG format for the images and TXT format for corresponding metadata files. There are images of 1,573 individuals (cases) 1,495 male and 78 female. \r\n\r\n The database contains both front and side (profile) views when available. Separating front views and profiles, there are 131 cases with two or more front views and 1,418 with only one front view. Profiles have 89 cases with two or more profiles and 1,268 with only one profile. Cases with both fronts and profiles have 89 cases with two or more of both fronts and profiles, 27 with two or more fronts and one profile, and 1,217 with only one front and one profile."
