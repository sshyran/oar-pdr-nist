        "The National Software Reference Library (NSRL)  collects software from various sources and incorporates file profiles computed from this software into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can be used by law enforcement, government, and industry organizations to review files on a computer by matching file profiles in the RDS. This alleviates much of the effort involved in determining which files are important as evidence on computers or file systems that have been seized as part of criminal investigations. The RDS is a collection of digital signatures of known, traceable software applications. There are application hash values in the hash set which may be considered malicious, i.e. steganography tools and hacking scripts. There are no hash values of illicit data, i.e. child abuse images."
