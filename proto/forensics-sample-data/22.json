        "Evaluation of Lateral and Depth Resolutions of Light Field Cameras: Light field cameras have the potential of becoming inexpensive and portable 3D imaging instruments. However, the suitability of this camera to a specific application depends on resolution requirements.  This data set was collected to assess the image resolution of light field cameras during acquisition configurations similar to the ones encountered by forensic photographers at crime scenes. Examples of 3D crime scene objects include tire tread and shoe imprints in substances like mud or snow. More information about the acquisition is provided at https://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb/resources/csmet/pages/lytro_camera/lytro_camera.html. The  data are available for assessing resolution parameters for other applications of light field cameras at https://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb/resources/lytroEvaluations/index.html."
