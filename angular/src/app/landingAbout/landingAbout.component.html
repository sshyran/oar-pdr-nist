    <p>

      The NIST Public Data Repository (PDR) is a key component of NIST research data infrastructure supporting public
      dissemination through open data sharing and access to an evolving collection of NIST public datasets.
      The main goals aim to communicate the results of NIST research to foster reproducibility, interoperability and
      discovery of scientific information for the community at large.
      Each PDR record includes descriptive information about a public data resource and corresponds to an entry in the
      NIST Enterprise Data Inventory, a fully compliant <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov">government open data
        standard </a> listing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PDR is designed as a trusted repository, one which complies with long term data preservation and publication
      standards.
      Each record is viewable through a unique web <b>“landing page”</b> which includes user-friendly and readable views
      of the record description and metadata, high level terms which detail the nature of the record dataset.
      Additionally through the PDR landing page interface, users have access to underlying data files, <a
        href="https://www.nist.gov/director/copyright-fair-use-and-licensing-statements-srd-data-and-software">Fair Use
        policy</a> and citation information, and a suite of related details including linkage to the machine readable
      version of the record.
      The top banner “Search” feature navigates to the <a href="https://data.nist.gov">NIST Data Discovery</a> portal
      where users may perform queries and explore the PDR datasets of interest.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, the NIST PDR implements the following features based on <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">FAIR data principles</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search and Navigation for NIST public datasets</li>
      <li>Citable web landing pages for published datasets with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)</li>
      <li>Find author related publications</li>
      <li>Access methods to retrieve data files</li>
      <li>Interoperability through machine readable standard formats of datasets</li>
      <li>Long term digital preservation</li>
    </ul>
